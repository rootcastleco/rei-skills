# Similarity Search Patterns

Patterns for implementing efficient similarity search in production systems.

## Use this skill when

- Building semantic search systems
- Implementing RAG retrieval
- Creating recommendation engines
- Optimizing search latency
- Scaling to millions of vectors
- Combining semantic and keyword search

## Do not use this skill when

- The task is unrelated to similarity search patterns
- You need a different domain or tool outside this scope

## Instructions

- Clarify goals, constraints, and required inputs.
- Apply relevant best practices and validate outcomes.
- Provide actionable steps and verification.
- If detailed examples are required, open `resources/implementation-playbook.md`.

## Resources

- `resources/implementation-playbook.md` for detailed patterns and examples.
