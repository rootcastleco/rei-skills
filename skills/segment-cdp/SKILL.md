# Segment CDP

## Patterns

### Analytics.js Browser Integration

Client-side tracking with Analytics.js. Include track, identify, page,
and group calls. Anonymous ID persists until identify merges with user.


### Server-Side Tracking with Node.js

High-performance server-side tracking using @segment/analytics-node.
Non-blocking with internal batching. Essential for backend events,
webhooks, and sensitive data.


### Tracking Plan Design

Design event schemas using Object + Action naming convention.
Define required properties, types, and validation rules.
Connect to Protocols for enforcement.


## Anti-Patterns

### ❌ Dynamic Event Names

### ❌ Tracking Properties as Events

### ❌ Missing Identify Before Track
