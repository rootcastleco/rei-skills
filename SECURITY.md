## Reporting a Vulnerability

**DO NOT** open a public Issue for security exploits.

If you find a security vulnerability (e.g., a skill that executes malicious code, bypasses authorization checks, or leaks sensitive information):

1. **Email:** `admin@rootcastle.com` — Include detailed reproduction steps.
2. **Or** open a **Private Advisory** on this repository.
3. We will acknowledge receipt within **48 hours** and provide a resolution timeline.

## Offensive Skills Policy

This repository contains skills for penetration testing, red teaming, and vulnerability analysis. These are provided for **authorized educational and professional use only**.

> ⚠️ **WARNING:** Offensive security skills must only be used against systems you own or have explicit written authorization to test. Unauthorized use may violate local, national, or international laws.

Please read our [Security Guardrails](docs/SECURITY_GUARDRAILS.md) for detailed guidelines.

## Security Hardening

All skills in this repository have been audited for:

- **Hardcoded credentials** — No API keys, tokens, or passwords
- **Dangerous commands** — Risky shell operations are flagged with warnings  
- **Authorization warnings** — Offensive/pentest skills include mandatory disclaimers
- **Input validation** — Skills that handle user input follow secure patterns
